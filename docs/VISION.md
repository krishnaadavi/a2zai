# A2Z AI Vision

## Product North Star

Build the most useful intelligence platform for AI builders and investors.

Working positioning:
- "Bloomberg for AI builders/investors."
- Track AI companies, startups, funding, and model releases in one place.
- Turn noisy AI news into structured, actionable signals.

## Problem

AI information is fragmented across blogs, social posts, research feeds, and market updates. Users spend too much time collecting data and too little time making decisions.

## Target Users

- AI founders and product leaders
- Operators at AI-native startups
- Investors (angel, micro-VC, growth, public market participants)
- Analysts and researchers tracking AI ecosystem movement

## Core Jobs To Be Done

- "Tell me what changed in my AI watchlist today."
- "Help me spot important funding and product-release signals early."
- "Summarize implications, not just headlines."
- "Let me track companies/models/startups from web and mobile."

## Product Pillars

1. Intelligence Feed
   - Curated high-signal updates across companies, startups, funding, models.
2. Entity Tracking
   - Follow companies, startups, and models with personalized watchlists.
3. Briefing Engine
   - Daily and weekly intelligence briefs with "why this matters."
4. Learning (Secondary Pillar)
   - AI education remains available, but is positioned as a secondary section.

## Differentiation

- Structured signal layer (events, entities, momentum), not just article links.
- Personalized watchlist-centric experience.
- Fast scan UX designed for decision-making.
- Unified web + mobile experience.

## Success Outcomes (12 months)

- Users open A2Z AI to check "what changed today" in AI.
- Strong repeat behavior driven by watchlists and alerts.
- Monetization via premium intelligence features (not ad-driven click feed).
